# impression: 
### to have or create a strong impact on someone, whether good or bad

Emotions have a lasting impression, how you act towards someone will be a basis for how they treat you. This program will let you visualize the emotions you portray and how they can haunt you. Different colors represent different emotions; the more you portray one emotion, the more the circle becomes that color. If it’s positive emotions that’s great, you’re leaving a good lasting impression. If you get a negative emotion, work to rid it from your circle.
The colors of the emotions are not provided because it is up to you, the user to determine what action/expression achieves the listed emotions and the corresponding color. The emotions that you will be seeking to express are:
*shock
*disbelief
*happiness
*shame
*defiance
*confusion
*boredom

Can you make a circle of just happiness and defiance or does disbelief somehow keep popping in occasionally?

Line up the outline of your face with the guidelines and experiment. Adjust your head along with your expressions and see what movements activate the emotion. 

### SHOCK | light purple |
### DISBELIEF | turquoise |
### HAPPINESS | yellow |
### SHAME | dark purple |
